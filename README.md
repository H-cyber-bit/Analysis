Customer Churn Analysis – Teco Telecom
Data Analysis Project

Conducted a comprehensive churn analysis for a telecom company to uncover key patterns influencing customer retention. Leveraged statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to identify actionable business insights:

Contract Type Impact: Found that customers on month-to-month contracts churned at a rate of 42%, compared to only 11% on annual and 3% on two-year contracts—highlighting the strong retention value of long-term plans.

Payment Method Insight: Detected a high churn rate (45%) among users paying via electronic checks, versus an average of 15–18% for those using credit cards or bank transfers—suggesting trust and convenience issues.

Tenure Effect: Customers within their first year had a 50% churn rate, dropping to 15% for those with over three years of tenure. This emphasized the importance of targeted onboarding and early engagement.

Demographic Trends: Senior citizens showed a significantly higher churn rate (41%) than younger customers (26%), indicating a need for specialized retention strategies for older demographics.

Service Type Insight: Fiber optic users churned at 30%, while DSL users churned at only 20%, pointing toward possible service satisfaction issues.

Tools Used: Analyzed data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), performed segmentation analysis, and created bar/line charts to visualize patterns clearly.

Business Recommendations:

Encourage long-term contracts through incentives.

Migrate users from electronic checks to secure payment methods.

Focus on customer experience in the first year.

Design tailored retention plans for senior customers.
